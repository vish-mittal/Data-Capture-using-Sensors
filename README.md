## Project: Human Activity Data Collection

### Introduction
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the field of research concerned with identifying specific physical activities of a person using sensor data. Examples of human activities are: walking, running, sitting, sleeping, driving, etc. HAR has been applied to keep track of elderly people, in the design of smart home environments, in human-computer interaction, and smart driving assistants.
As a data scientist/analyst, you are required to collect sensor data from a group of subjects and to store the data in a structured way, so it can be used for further analysis. Knowing the data capture process and how to use sensors to collect data are skills that help the data scientist to understand the data, identify possible sources of errors, and to determine an appropriate data preparation procedure.
